#  Technical Writing Portfolio – Tim Blackburn

Welcome! This repository showcases my **technical writing and communication work**, blending real-world enterprise documentation with independent projects and creative technical guides.  
It demonstrates my ability to **explain complex technology clearly**, whether through official product documentation, internal playbooks, or small development projects.

##  Cisco Meraki Go Documentation

I was the **original author** of several published Cisco Meraki Go knowledge base articles.  
These resources have since been edited and updated by others, but the **initial structure, content, and flow** originated from my work.  

**Published Work (Cisco Meraki Official Site):**
- [Configuring VLANs in Meraki Go](https://documentation.meraki.com/Go/Features/Configuring_VLANs_in_Meraki_Go)  
- [Local Network Addressing](https://documentation.meraki.com/Go/Features/Meraki_Go_-_Local_Network_Addressing)  
- [Troubleshooting Tools](https://documentation.meraki.com/Go/Meraki_Go_-_Support/Meraki_Go_-_Troubleshooting_Tools)  
- [Recommended Meraki Go Topology](https://documentation.meraki.com/Go/Installation_and_Configuration/Meraki_Go_-_Recommended_Meraki_Go_Topology)  
- [Enabling Multi-Factor Authentication](https://documentation.meraki.com/Go/How_To_Guides/Enabling_Multi-Factor_Authentication_in_Meraki_Go)  
- [Reset Password](https://documentation.meraki.com/Go/How_To_Guides/Meraki_Go_-_Reset_Password)

## Daily Inspiration CLI (Python Project)
This project is a lightweight command-line tool that fetches random inspirational quotes from the ZenQuotes API, with a fallback list for offline use.  

It demonstrates:
- API integration and error handling
- Clean CLI output with date/time
- Clear end-user and developer documentation

## Inspirational CLI Project

This is a **Python-based command-line tool** that fetches inspirational quotes from the ZenQuotes API (with a fallback list for offline use).  

- Written in **Python** (requests, datetime, random)  
- Includes a **Jupyter Notebook tutorial** explaining every step (great for teaching beginners)  
- Example of **docs-as-code**: the tutorial doubles as documentation and training material  

### Features
- Fetches a live quote + author from an API  
- Falls back to stored quotes if offline  
- Prints with formatted headers and timestamps  
- Tutorial notebook demonstrates step-by-step code, explanations, and exercises  

 [View the Jupyter Notebook Tutorial](Inspirational-Project-CLI-Tutorial.ipynb)

## Additional Writing Samples

Coming soon:  
- A “Getting Started Guide” for a security/identity-focused demo tool.  
- A mock API Reference document (to showcase docs-as-code style).  
- A troubleshooting flow for a sample SaaS deployment.
