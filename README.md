Welcome! This repository showcases my **technical writing and communication work**, blending real-world enterprise documentation with independent projects and creative technical guides.

## 🚀 Cisco Meraki Go Documentation

I was the **original author** of several published Cisco Meraki Go knowledge base articles.  
These resources have since been edited and updated by others, but the **initial structure, content, and flow** originated from my work.  

**Published Work (Meraki Official Site):**
- [Configuring VLANs in Meraki Go](https://documentation.meraki.com/Go/Features/Configuring_VLANs_in_Meraki_Go)  
- [Local Network Addressing](https://documentation.meraki.com/Go/Features/Meraki_Go_-_Local_Network_Addressing)  
- [Troubleshooting Tools](https://documentation.meraki.com/Go/Meraki_Go_-_Support/Meraki_Go_-_Troubleshooting_Tools)  
- [Recommended Meraki Go Topology](https://documentation.meraki.com/Go/Installation_and_Configuration/Meraki_Go_-_Recommended_Meraki_Go_Topology)  
- [Enabling Multi-Factor Authentication](https://documentation.meraki.com/Go/How_To_Guides/Enabling_Multi-Factor_Authentication_in_Meraki_Go)
