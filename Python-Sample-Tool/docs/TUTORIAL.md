# Inspirational CLI Tutorial

Welcome! This notebook will walk you through building and understanding the **Daily Inspiration CLI** project step by step.  

By the end, you will understand:
1. How to **import Python modules**.
2. How to **define fallback quotes** using lists.
3. How to **fetch live data from an API**.
4. How to **gracefully handle errors**.
5. How to **run the full CLI tool**.

We‚Äôll use beginner-friendly explanations so even if you‚Äôre new to Python, you‚Äôll understand what‚Äôs happening.

## Step 1: Importing Required Modules  

We need to load some tools (called *modules* or *libraries*) that extend Python‚Äôs abilities:  

- `requests`: lets us fetch live data from APIs on the internet.  
- `datetime`: lets us print the current date/time.  
- `random`: lets us randomly pick a fallback quote if the API fails.  



```python
import requests
from datetime import datetime
import random

```

## Step 2: Define Fallback Quotes  

Sometimes the API won‚Äôt respond (bad internet, server down, etc.).  
To make sure our program *always* shows something, we‚Äôll prepare a **list of backup quotes**.  



```python
FALLBACK_QUOTES = [
    "The best way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing. ‚Äì Walt Disney",
    "Don‚Äôt let yesterday take up too much of today. ‚Äì Will Rogers",
    "It‚Äôs not whether you get knocked down, it‚Äôs whether you get up. ‚Äì Vince Lombardi",
    "If you are working on something exciting, it will keep you motivated. ‚Äì Steve Jobs"
]

```

## Step 3: Fetch Quotes from the API  

We‚Äôll use the **ZenQuotes API** to fetch real inspirational quotes.  

This code:  
1. Sends a request to `https://zenquotes.io/api/random`.  
2. If the request succeeds, it grabs the quote text + author.  
3. If the request fails, it picks one from our `FALLBACK_QUOTES`.  



```python
def get_quote():
    """Fetch a random inspirational quote from ZenQuotes API or fallback list."""
    try:
        response = requests.get("https://zenquotes.io/api/random", timeout=5)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            data = response.json()
            return f"‚Äú{data[0]['q']}‚Äù ‚Äì {data[0]['a']}"
    except Exception:
        return random.choice(FALLBACK_QUOTES)

```

## Step 4: Run the CLI  

Now let‚Äôs bring it all together.  
We‚Äôll print a **header**, today‚Äôs **date/time**, and an inspirational quote.  



```python
print("="*50)
print("üí° Daily Inspiration CLI üí°")
print(f"Date: {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}")
print("="*50)
print(get_quote())
print("="*50)

```
